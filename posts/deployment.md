## Introduction

This article covers the process of deploying our static blog to Vercel, from initial setup to production best practices.

## Why Vercel for Next.js

### Native Integration

- Developed by the creators of Next.js
- Zero-configuration deployment
- Automatic recognition of Next.js features

### Performance Benefits

- Global edge network
- Automatic static optimization
- Instant cache invalidation

## Preparation Steps

### Project Requirements

- Next.js 13+ project
- Configured `next.config.js` for static export:

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    output: "export",
  };
  ```

- All dependencies committed to Git

### Vercel Account Setup

1. Create free Vercel account
2. Install Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel`)
3. Connect Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

## Deployment Process

### First-Time Deployment

1. Run `vercel` in project root
2. Follow interactive prompts:
   - Set project name
   - Choose "Next.js" framework preset
   - Confirm output directory (auto-detected)
3. Deploy to production (`vercel --prod`)

### Subsequent Deployments

- Automatic deployments via Git integration
- Triggered by pushes to connected branch
- Preview deployments for pull requests

## Configuration Options

### Project Settings

- Build command: `next build && next export`
- Output directory: `out`
- Node.js version: Matches local environment

### Environment Variables

- Add through Vercel dashboard
- Available at build time and runtime
- Can be encrypted for security

## Custom Domain Setup

### Adding a Domain

1. Navigate to project Domains settings
2. Enter desired domain name
3. Follow DNS verification steps

### DNS Configuration

- Recommended: Use Vercel nameservers
- Alternative: Configure A/CNAME records
- Automatic SSL certificates provisioned

## Optimizing Performance

### Cache Settings

- Automatic edge caching
- Custom cache headers configuration
- Manual cache purge when needed

### Image Optimization

- Next.js Image component works automatically
- On-demand image optimization
- WebP conversion by default

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Built-in Monitoring

- Real-time deployment logs
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Error tracking integration

### Third-Party Integrations

- Connect Google Analytics
- Add Sentry for error tracking
- Enable Web Vitals reporting

## Advanced Features

### Preview Deployments

- Automatic for every Git push
- Shareable URLs for testing
- Protected with authentication options

### Rollback Capabilities

- Instant revert to previous versions
- Deployment history timeline
- Permanent URLs for each deploy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Missing static files in `out` directory
- Incorrect build command configuration
- Environment variable mismatches

### Debugging Steps

1. Check deployment logs
2. Test build locally (`next build && next export`)
3. Verify file structure in `out` directory

## Maintenance Best Practices

### Automatic Updates

- Enable dependency updates through Vercel
- Scheduled redeployments for content changes
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Security Considerations

- Regular dependency audits
- Environment variable protection
- Permission management for team members

## Conclusion

Vercel provides the most streamlined deployment experience for Next.js static blogs, handling everything from global distribution to automatic optimizations.
