## One Stylesheet

Our global CSS file at `styles/globals.css` and imported in `_app.tsx` ensures app-wide coverage. The CSS follows a flat structure without nesting, making it easier to maintain and reason about. A mobile-first approach guides the responsive design implementation, and semantic class naming conventions help developers understand style purposes at a glance.

## Core Style Categories

### Base Element Styles

The stylesheet begins by establishing sensible defaults for raw HTML elements. The body element sets the foundation with a clean Tahoma font stack and light gray background. Headings receive consistent vertical spacing with 2rem margins on both top and bottom, creating a clear content hierarchy. Images are styled to be fluid containers with pleasant rounded corners.

```css
body {
  font-family: "Tahoma", sans-serif;
  font-weight: normal;
  background: #f9f9f9;
}

h2,
h3,
h4 {
  margin-top: 2rem;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}

img {
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

### Layout Components

Structural elements receive special attention to ensure proper content organization. The container class establishes a centered content area with appropriate padding and overflow handling. Header and footer elements share a distinctive dark blue color scheme that contrasts with the light main content area.

```css
.container {
  max-width: 76rem;
  margin: auto;
  overflow: auto;
  padding: 0 1rem;
}

header,
footer {
  background: #36445f;
  color: #f9f9f9;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

### Utility Classes

Reusable utility patterns like buttons are defined for consistent implementation throughout the application. The button class includes subtle interactive feedback through a gentle scale transformation on hover, enhancing the user experience.

```css
.btn {
  display: inline-block;
  background: steelblue;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 0.5rem 0.7rem;
  border-radius: 0.3rem;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

.btn:hover {
  transform: scale(0.98);
}
```

## Typography System

The typography system relies primarily on the Tahoma typeface with fallbacks to system sans-serif fonts for maximum compatibility. Font weights are normalized across elements to maintain visual consistency. The vertical rhythm is carefully controlled using a base spacing unit of 1rem, with paragraph elements receiving 1rem bottom margins and headings getting 2rem spacing on both top and bottom.

## Color Palette

The color scheme is built around a restrained palette that supports readability and visual hierarchy. The primary background uses a light gray (#f9f9f9) that reduces eye strain, while headers and footers feature a dark blue (#36445f) that provides strong contrast. Steelblue serves as the primary accent color throughout the interface. Text colors automatically adapt to their backgrounds, maintaining proper contrast ratios in all contexts.

## Responsive Design

The responsive implementation uses a single mobile breakpoint at 50rem (800px) to adjust layouts for smaller screens. This approach keeps the CSS manageable while still providing good mobile experiences. Elements like the posts grid switch to a single-column layout below this breakpoint. Fluid design principles ensure container elements, images, and spacing adapt smoothly across viewport sizes.

```css
@media (max-width: 50rem) {
  .posts {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

## Component-Specific Styles

### Card Components

Card elements receive special styling to create visual distinction and hierarchy. Both regular cards and page cards feature rounded corners and subtle shadows, with page cards receiving additional horizontal padding to better frame their content.

```css
.card {
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 0 0.4rem 0.8rem 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.card-page {
  padding: 1.5rem 3rem;
}
```

### Post Elements

Post-specific elements like dates and code blocks receive customized styling. Dates are highlighted with a light gray background and rounded edges, while code blocks in post content get generous padding and increased line height for better readability.

```css
.post-date {
  background: #e5e4e2;
  padding: 0.3rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}

.post-body pre {
  padding: 2rem;
  margin: 2rem 0;
  line-height: 2.3;
}
```

## Performance Considerations

The stylesheet is optimized for performance through several deliberate choices. Selector complexity is minimized to reduce rendering overhead, and expensive CSS properties are used sparingly. The entire file remains compact at under 5KB, ensuring fast loading times. Render optimization techniques include strategic use of GPU-accelerated properties and appropriate will-change declarations where animations occur.

## Maintenance Strategy

The stylesheet is organized to support long-term maintainability. Related styles are grouped logically with clear section comments, and properties within rulesets are ordered alphabetically for consistent scanning. This structure makes it straightforward to add new global styles, extend the color system, or introduce additional utility classes as the blog evolves.

## Browser Support

The styling system targets modern evergreen browsers without specific support for legacy platforms like IE11. A progressive enhancement approach ensures core functionality remains accessible even when advanced styling features aren't available. Vendor prefixing is handled primarily through an Autoprefixer in the build process, with manual prefixes only applied where absolutely necessary to balance support requirements with bundle size.
